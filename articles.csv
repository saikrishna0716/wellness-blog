"Understanding Cholesterol: The Good, The Bad, and How to Find Balance","Dr. Do Little","October 31, 2025","Cholesterol often gets a bad reputation, but the truth is more nuanced. Your body actually needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, produce hormones, and maintain vital functions. The key is understanding the difference between HDL (good) cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol, and how to maintain healthy levels through diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices. High LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. However, you can significantly improve your cholesterol profile through strategic dietary changes like reducing saturated fats, increasing fiber intake with whole grains and vegetables, eating heart-healthy omega-3 rich fish, and incorporating regular physical activity. Even modest changes like a 30-minute daily walk can raise HDL levels. This comprehensive guide explains what your cholesterol numbers mean, which foods to embrace and avoid, the role of genetics versus lifestyle, when medication might be necessary, and actionable steps you can take today to protect your cardiovascular health for years to come.","nutrition|diet|heart-health","nutrition|wellness|heart-health"
